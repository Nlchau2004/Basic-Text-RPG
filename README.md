# Basic-Text-RPG
By Nathan Chau and Christopher Nguyen

As a part of the AP Computer Science Principles Create Task, my partner and I decided to create a text-rpg using python.  

The game begins with some background of the protagonist and antagonist, along with the motives of each character. The battle system of the game is turn-based, meaning that each character attacks each other through turns. 

In order to accomplish this task, we used:
- Conditionals
- Iteration
- Classes
- Planning
